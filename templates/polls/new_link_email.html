Hello,

You're receiving this email because {{admin}} changed the link of your ballot and the visibility of the poll.

Here is the new link to vote:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{%  url 'vote:get_ballot_view' poll.pk voter_uuid %}
{%  if voter_uuid == 'public' %}
The poll is now public and everoyone can participate with this link and access to the result.
{% else %}
The poll is now private and this link is personnal. Only registered voters and the admin can vote and see the results.
{%  endif %}

Here is the link for the final results:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{%  url 'vote:results' poll.pk voter_uuid %}
{% if poll.temporary %} You can also see the temporary results
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{%  url 'vote:temp_results' poll.pk voter_uuid %}{% endif %}

Thanks for using Pnyx!
